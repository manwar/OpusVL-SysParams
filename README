OpusVL-SysParams

OpusVL::SysParams - Module to handle system wide parameters

The idea is to allow the storage and retrieval of system wide parameters.  The OpusVL::SysParams is the 
main interface onto this storage and provides simple get/set methods.  This uses a DBIx::Class::Schema
to store the data.  

If you want to integrate this into an existing DBIx::Class Schema you can use a Role to apply to your
schema to inject the necessary tables and a schema level sys_params object.

    # in your schema class.
    with 'OpusVL::SysParams::RolesFor::Schema';
    OpusVL::SysParams::RolesFor::Schema->setup_sysparams(__PACKAGE__);

    # now anywhere that has access to the schema can access the 
    # sys_params object.
    $schema->sys_params->get('param.name'); 

FIXME: To use it stand alone you can use a regular Catalyst style config file to initialise the schema.
